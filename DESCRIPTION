Description: MetCirc comprises a workflow to interactively explore 
  high-resolution MS/MS metabolomics data. MetCirc uses the Spectrum2 and 
  Spectra infrastructure defined in the package MSnbase that store 
  MS/MS spectra. MetCirc offers functionality to calculate 
  similarity between precursors based on the normalised dot product, neutral
  losses or user-defined functions and 
  visualise similarities in a circular layout. Within the interactive framework
  the user can annotate MS/MS features based on their similarity to 
  (known) related MS/MS features.
